            <p>
                This was my final project for my Art 101 course.
                In this project, I combined game software with a productivity software for a timer based on the Pomodoro technique.
                The Pomodoro technique is 25 minutes of work followed by a 5 minute break.
                This 30 minute set is called a 'pomodoro' and a longer break should be taken after 4 pomodoros.
                <br><br>
                The p5.js libraries I used in my project are
                <a href="https://github.com/mveteanu/p5.SceneManager">p5.scenemanager</a>,
                <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound">p5.sound</a>,
                and <a href="https://github.com/L05/p5.touchgui">p5.toughgui</a>.
                <br><br>
                During the 25 minute study scene, the interface shows a countdown of the minutes and involves a simulation interface context.
                The simulation is of an alien character building a space ship to represent how the user is working hard on their own task
                for 25 minutes. This alien scene plays throughout a minute and repeats every minute for the whole 25 minutes.
                In addition, motivational messages will show up for 10 seconds, every minute starting at 35 seconds to encourage users to
                work on their tasks. There is also background sound of light rain that plays throughout the study scene, as a calming way
                to help the user stay focused.
                <br><br>
                The game software is introduced after the 25 minutes of work and study time is over.
                The scene switches automatically when the timer reaches 00:00.
                In the game scene, users have the ability to move the alien character using the joystick controller on the screen.
                Users can also click 'b'
                or 'B' to shoot laser beams at the cow, allowing them to score points. There is feedback sound that plays every time the
                user shoots a laser, and a different feedback sound plays when the user scores a point. Theatricfication is included in 
                in the game by having the alien character tilt in the direction that the user moves it in,
                and by having the laser beam also move in the direction the alien was moving in.
                <br><br>
                After the 5 minute game scene ends, the program moves back to the study scene and a counter of the pomodoros is incremented.
                After 4 pomodoros, the user is shown the "end" scene where they may take a longer break on their own, and can
                click a button to start from the beginning again.
                More details of the interface for my project include short sound effects that play each time a button is clicked.
                I included this to indicate to the user that their interaction with the software was successful.
                In addition, every scene has a 'Help' button that navigates to the About/Help scene where the user can choose to go
                back to the previous page or go back to the 'Home' beginning screen. The study and game scene are paused while on the help screen.
